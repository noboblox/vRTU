# vRTU
 A virtual remote terminal unit impementation for IEC 60870.
 
 The purpose of this project is to expose SCADA protocol functionality to a REST like interface.
 As the project is work in progress it is mostly non-functional at the moment.

 The first implementation focuses on basic IEC 60870-5-104 functionality in slave (server-like) mode.
